 * Version 1.0.0—the first official stable release of `pg_extra_time`—didn't
 * entail any functional changes, just a commitment, following the [semantic
 * versioning](https://semver.org/) semantics, to henceforth increment the
 * major version number in the case of any changes that break backward
 * compatibility for users of this extension.

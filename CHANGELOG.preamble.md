# `pg_extra_time` changelog / release notes

All notable changes to the `pg_extra_time` PostgreSQL extension will be
documented in this changelog.

The format of this changelog is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).  `pg_extra_time` adheres to
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This changelog is **automatically generated** and is updated by running `make
CHANGELOG.md`.  This preamble is kept in `CHANGELOG.preamble.md` and the
remainded of the changelog below is synthesized (by `sql-to-changelog.md.sql`)
from special comments in the extension update scripts, put in the right sequence
with the help of the `pg_extension_update_paths()` functions (meaning that the
extension update script must be installed where Postgres can find them before an
up-to-date `CHANGELOG.md` file can be generated).
